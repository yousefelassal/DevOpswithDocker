## Image and Containers

an image is like a blueprint or template, while a container is an instance of that blueprint or template.

### Image

A Docker image is a file. An image never changes; you can not edit an existing file. Creating a new image happens by starting from a base image and adding new **layers** to it. Images are _immutable_, they can not be changed after they are created.

**Dockerfile**
```Dockerfile
FROM <image>:<tag>

RUN <install some dependencies>

CMD <command that is executed on `docker container run`>
```

### Container

Containers only contain that which is required to execute an application; and you can start, stop and interact with them. They are **isolated** environments in the host machine with the ability to interact with each other and the host machine itself via defined methods (TCP/UDP).

### Most used commands

| command | explain | shorthand  |
|---|---|---|
| `docker image ls` | Lists all images | `docker images` |
| `docker image rm <image>` | Removes an image | `docker rmi` |
| `docker image pull <image>` | Pulls image from a docker registry | `docker pull`|
| `docker container ls -a` | Lists all containers | `docker ps -a` |
| `docker container run <image>` | Runs a container from an image | `docker run` |
| `docker container rm <container>` | Removes a container | `docker rm` |
| `docker container stop <container>` | Stops a container | `docker stop`|
| `docker container exec <container>` | Executes a command inside the containerÂ | `docker exec` |
