## Image and Containers

an image is like a blueprint or template, while a container is an instance of that blueprint or template.

### Image

A Docker image is a file. An image never changes; you can not edit an existing file. Creating a new image happens by starting from a base image and adding new **layers** to it. Images are _immutable_, they can not be changed after they are created.

**Dockerfile**
```Dockerfile
FROM <image>:<tag>

RUN <install some dependencies>

CMD <command that is executed on `docker container run`>
```

### Container

Containers only contain that which is required to execute an application; and you can start, stop and interact with them. They are **isolated** environments in the host machine with the ability to interact with each other and the host machine itself via defined methods (TCP/UDP).

### Most used commands

| command | explain | shorthand  |
|---|---|---|
| `docker image ls` | Lists all images | `docker images` |
| `docker image rm <image>` | Removes an image | `docker rmi` |
| `docker image pull <image>` | Pulls image from a docker registry | `docker pull`|
| `docker container ls -a` | Lists all containers | `docker ps -a` |
| `docker container run <image>` | Runs a container from an image | `docker run` |
| `docker container rm <container>` | Removes a container | `docker rm` |
| `docker container stop <container>` | Stops a container | `docker stop`|
| `docker start <container_name_or_id>` | Start an exited container | `docker start <container_id_prefix>` |
| `docker container exec <container>` | Executes a command inside the containerÂ | `docker exec` |

If you have hundreds of stopped containers and you wish to delete them all, you should use 
- `docker container prune` (deletes all stopped containers)
- `docker image prune` (remove "dangling" images)
- `docker system prune` (clears almost everything)


# Running and stopping containers

run Ubuntu
```cmd
docker run ubuntu
```
- `-i` (interactive)
- `-t` ([tty](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-tty-in-linux/))

```
docker run -d -it --name looper ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'
```

- `docker run -d` run container detached.
- `-it` is short for `-i` and `-t` allows you to interact with the container by using the command line.
- Because we ran the container with `--name looper`, we can now reference it easily.


### Let's follow `-f` the output of logs with
```
$ docker logs -f looper
  Thu Mar  1 15:51:29 UTC 2023
  Thu Mar  1 15:51:30 UTC 2023
  Thu Mar  1 15:51:31 UTC 2023
  ...
```

### Let's test pausing the looper without exiting or stopping it.
- `docker pause looper`
- `docker unpause looper`

### attach to the running container from the second terminal using `attach`:
```
$ docker attach looper
  Thu Mar  1 15:54:38 UTC 2023
  Thu Mar  1 15:54:39 UTC 2023
  ...
```
- If we want to attach to a container while making sure we don't close it from the other terminal we can specify to not attach STDIN with `--no-stdin` option.
- start the stopped container with `docker start looper`

### Running processes inside a container with docker exec
execute commands within a running container - `docker exec` command.
```bash
docker exec <CONTAINER> ls -la
```
We can execute the Bash shell in the container in interactive mode and then run any commands within that Bash session:
```bash
docker exec -it <CONTAINER> bash
root@2a49df3ba735:/# ps aux

  USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
  root        64  1.5  0.0   4112  3460 pts/1    Ss   12:36   0:00 bash
  root        80  0.0  0.0   5900  2844 pts/1    R+   12:36   0:00 ps aux
```
we can exit the container with `exit`.

### To terminate the process, stop follows the SIGTERM with a SIGKILL after a grace period. In this case, it's simply faster to use kill.
```
$ docker kill looper
$ docker rm looper
```
- Running the previous two commands is basically equivalent to running `docker rm --force looper`


```
$ docker run -d --rm -it --name looper-it ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do date; sleep 1; done'
```
`--rm` removes the process automatically after it has exited. The `--rm` ensures that there are no garbage containers left behind. It also means that `docker start` can not be used to start the container after it has exited.

### Building Images
We will choose [Alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org/), a small Linux distribution that is often used to create small images.

```Dockerfile
# Start from the alpine image that is smaller but no fancy tools
FROM alpine:3.19

# Use /usr/src/app as our workdir. The following instructions will be executed in this location.
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the hello.sh file from this directory to /usr/src/app/ creating /usr/src/app/hello.sh
COPY hello.sh .

# Alternatively, if we skipped chmod earlier, we can add execution permissions during the build.
# RUN chmod +x hello.sh

# When running docker run the command will be ./hello.sh
CMD ./hello.sh
```

Copying files using `docker cp`

```bash
$ docker ps
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND   CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
  9c06b95e3e85   hello-docker   "sh"      4 minutes ago   Up 4 minutes             zen_rosalind
  
$ touch additional.txt
$ docker cp ./additional.txt zen_rosalind:/usr/src/app/
```
